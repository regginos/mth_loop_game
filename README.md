loop_game
=========
Loop game is a musical game. It produces a grid where columns represent beats and lines represent notes.
The pattern is repeated ad infinitum producing a loop. User can chose which note(notes) is played on which beat.
Uses "Web Audio", a new web technology (http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/). 

Web Audio API availability in different browsers can be found [here](http://caniuse.com/audio-api).

If you have any interest in this code, you will notice it is designed as a Drupal 7 module. This is done for 2 reasons:
1. I plan to add feature for saving/sharing loops between users online.
2. Need the game to be translated.
Drupal has built-in user system and translations system.
